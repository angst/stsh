# Stsh.me

Stsh.me is both an endpoint to upload screenshots for a tinygrab-like client, as well as a url shortener.

## Using stsh-client
If you would like to use stsh-client to upload your screenshots, just tell it to post to: 
	
	http://stsh.me/images

## Using the url shortener

If you would like to use the currently hosted url shortener; just send an http POST request to http://stsh.me/ with a string as your param. This should work as a simple API for all platforms.

On POST a url will be returned to you to share to the rest of the world.

Example:

	$ curl -d "http://google.com/" http://stsh.me/
	$ # => http://stsh.me/2d3
